    <h1>Designing a Start Here Section for Your Online Course</h1>

        <h2 style="color: crimson;">GitHub Pages Example</h2>

        <p style="color: crimson;">Static content like this could be easily transferred to an LMS</p>
        
    <p>In a face-to-face course, instructors often spend part of the first-class meeting going over the syllabus and class policies with students. Creating a designated Start Here area in your online course is like this. This is a place where you can include the most important information that students need to know to get off to a good start in your course. A Start Here area also allows you to emphasize things that are important for this course or expectations that you have for how students will interact with the content, each other, and you.</p>

    <p>How much information you include in the Start Here section is up to you as an instructor. At the minimum, though, we recommend including:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>A short welcome statement along with instructor contact information;</li>
        <li>Information on where to obtain technical support and the required technologies and technical skills needed to be successful in the course;</li>
        <li>An explanation of netiquette and online interaction expectations;</li>
        <li>Instructions to read the syllabus and calendar;</li>
        <li>Instructions for students to introduce themselves; and</li>
        <li>What students should do next to get started in the course.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Letâ€™s look a little more closely at each of these areas.</p>

    <h2>Welcome and Contact Information</h2>
    <p>A welcome statement can set the tone for a course, and there are a variety of approaches that you can take to constructing this statement. For example, you could create a welcome that also includes your self-introduction, or you could just post a short welcome here and then place your self-introduction in the discussion forum. Whatever your personal style, the main goal is to communicate:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>A tone that will help set the climate for the class,</li>
        <li>Information on how you prefer to be contacted, and</li>
        <li>When students can expect to hear back from you.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Keep in mind that communicating online is quite different from face-to-face. The facial expressions and tone of voice that we often depend upon in our face-to-face interactions are completely absent here. A friendly tone in your welcome can help relieve student anxieties and start the course off well.</p>

    <p>For your contact information, consider how you prefer students get in touch with you. Do you want them to email you directly or message you via another means such as the learning management system? Do you want them to call you on your office phone, or will you give your cell phone number out? Many instructors create a FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) discussion forum where certain questions are pre-answered or where students can ask general questions. If you do this in your course, then the welcome statement at the beginning of the course is a great place to tell students about the forum and guide them in how to use it.</p>

    <p>Additionally, let students know what your typical turnaround time is for answering emails or phone calls. Here, the turnaround time you choose is not as important as letting them know what to expect. For example, many instructors need time over the weekend to recharge or complete grading, so they let their students know that they will not be answering emails or phone calls during the weekends. Use this opportunity in the course to help set clear expectations.</p>

      <p style="color: crimson;">However, with GitHub Pages, you can also support dynamic content, as in this very simple example, a simple script that counts the
      number of times a button is clicked. </p>

    <button id="btn">Click Here!</button>
    <p>
        Button Clicked <span id="display">0</span> Times
    </p>
    <script type="text/javascript">
        let count = 0;
        let btn = document.getElementById("btn");
        let disp = document.getElementById("display");
         
        btn.onclick = function () {
                    count++;
        disp.innerHTML = count;
        }
    </script>
</body>
